# Support Resources

Thanks for using Lithium-Next! If you run into issues or have questions, the resources below can help.

## 1. Self-Help

- **Documentation**: Review the docs in the `docs/` folder (e.g., `openapi-spec.yaml`, `astronomy_api_spec.md`).
- **README**: Covers quick start, build instructions, and project overview.
- **Existing Issues**: Search open and closed GitHub issues before filing new ones.

## 2. Asking for Help

1. **GitHub Issues** — Use the issue templates to report bugs or request features.
2. **Discussions** — If enabled, start a conversation in GitHub Discussions for Q&A or idea sharing.
3. **Community Channels** — Join the Lithium community (QQ 群 / Discord) announced in the README or project announcements for informal support.

## 3. Security or Responsible Disclosure

For potential vulnerabilities, please follow the steps in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.

## 4. Commercial / Enterprise Support

For partnership inquiries or priority support, contact the maintainers at [support@elementastro.org](mailto:support@elementastro.org).

We appreciate detailed reports that include logs, repro steps, and environment details. This helps maintainers respond faster.
