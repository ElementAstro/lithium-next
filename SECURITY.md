## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in Lithium-Next, please report it privately so we can investigate and release a fix before the details become public.

1. Email the maintainers at [security@elementastro.org](mailto:security@elementastro.org) with the subject line `SECURITY`.
2. Optionally open a "Security" issue on GitHub marked as private if you have access to GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/advisories/creating-a-security-advisory).
3. Please include the following information:
   - A detailed description of the issue and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
   - Affected version(s) and environment information.

## Response Process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
- Maintainers will coordinate a fix and keep you updated about progress.
- Once the fix is released, we will publish a security advisory crediting you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Responsible Disclosure

Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have provided a fix and coordinated release notes. We greatly appreciate researchers and community members who help keep Lithium-Next secure.
